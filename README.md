About:
    In this we will be computing how many times a trained image for a person comes and goes out of the frame.

libraries needed:
    opencv3
    dlib
    face_recognition

To run:
    1. input the image file as an argument.
    2. To get your name change the name from Anish to your name in the alpha.py

Future Versions:
    1. A class where you can use CNN to detect the image faster and accurate.
    2. an api (long shot)
