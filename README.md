About:
    In this we will be computing how many times a trained image for a person comes and goes out of the frame.

libraries needed:

    *   opencv3
    *   dlib
    *   face_recognition

To run:

    *   input the image file as an argument.
    *   To get your name change the name from Anish to your name in the alpha.py

Future Versions:

    *   A class where you can use CNN to detect the image faster and accurate.
    *   an api (long shot)
